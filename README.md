# Sleep Inc.

A sleep health company that recently launched a sleep-tracking app called SleepScope. The app monitors sleep patterns and collects users' self-reported data on lifestyle habits. SleepInc wants to identify lifestyle, health, and demographic factors that strongly correlate with poor sleep quality. They need your help to produce visualizations and a summary of findings for their next board meeting! They need these to be easily digestible for a non-technical audience!
